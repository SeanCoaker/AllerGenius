## AllerGenius

An application made for my University dissertation project. The app allows users to scan barcodes, view food labels digitally in a customisable way and log any foods they have eaten or symptoms that they have experienced. I have started adding an augmented reality feature for the barcode scanning, but this still needs work and is not fully functional in its current form.
