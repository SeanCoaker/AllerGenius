## AllerGenius

An application made for my University dissertation project. The app allows users to scan barcodes, view food labels digitally in a customisable way and log any foods they have eaten or symptoms that they have experienced. I have implemented an augmented reality feature for the barcode scanning, which is imperfect in its current form and needs a little tweaking.
